# About Orders

An order is created when a site visitor completes the checkout phase of a purchase. Orders can also be created, as well as managed directly via the Orders API.

An order holds information about purchased items, price and tax summaries, shipping and billing info, any applied discounts, payment and fulfillment statuses, and more.

The eCommerce Orders API replaces the soon to be deprecated [Stores Orders API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-stores/orders), [Events Order API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-events/wix-events/order), and [Bookings API](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-bookings/bookings/bookings).
