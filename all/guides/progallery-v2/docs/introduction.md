The Pro Gallery is a responsive, customizable gallery used to display high quality media in Wix sites.

# **Terminology**
**Gallery** - represent a ProGallery instance. A Gallery can have Items in it.

**Item** can be a Photo/ Video/ Text Item.

**State** -  a Gallery also has State which indicates whether the gallery is:

- Saved: the given gallery in the Editor segment
- Published, the given gallery in the LiveSite segment

For example, a user can edit his gallery in the editor, without publishing it. This will cause only the gallery in state SAVED
to be updated.
When the gallery will be published, those changes will be applied to the gallery in state PUBLISHED.
